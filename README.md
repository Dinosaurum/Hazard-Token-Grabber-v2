NOT MY WORK (SKIDDED)



Hello! I am pretty new on Github! Some days ago I found my old Hazard-Grabber directory and the repost with some changes from someone else. Enjoy this small remake.


As I said I'm new, but I will try my best <3
And yes, if you wanna call me that, you can call me a skid. That is the only thing I can do at the moment, but I'm trying to create my own projects. 
So don't worry, I'm not just a skid - I try my best!




Tutorial for starters (like me..) ↓↓

Step 1: Install python and make sure to add it to path. 

Step 2: So, how do you use this now? Enter the file named "hazard.py" with a code editor. I would recommend you Visual Studio Code. (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Step 3: Just put your webhook in line 29 where the code says "WEBHOOK HERE". Simply replace the webhook here with your webhook. You don't know how to create a webhook and copy it's URL? Here, buddy! https://www.integromat.com/en/blog/guide-to-discord-webhooks (only the first few steps under "How to create Discord webhooks?" are important.

(Step 4:) You can also change the settings from line 30 to 37. True is enabling the setting, false is disbaling a setting. Easy!

Step 5: How do I compile this shit now? That's pretty easy! Just run this command after you opened a command prompt in the Hazard-Grabber Directory and run this command: "pyinstaller hazard.py --onefile". Now wait for it to compile the file. 

(Step 6:) Change the ICON. I don't know good programs for this at the moment. I will try to add this soon. If you know how to do this, let me know under the "Issues" ➤➤  "Suggestions" Tab.

Step 7: Send the created .exe to your friends to troll them!



Thanks to everyone who read this ↑↑
